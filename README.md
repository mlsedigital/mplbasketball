# mplbasketball
Basketball plotting library for use with matplotlib. Currently a `Court()` object can be defined with an NBA or WNBA court. 

The current iteration of the code only works with Hawk-Eye data.

## TO DO

1. Constrained layout in `mpl` to ensure the proportions are right when plotting takes place.

2. Vertical half court plots. 

3. Heat maps.
